abstract: "We propose a novel neural waveform compression
method to catalyze emerging speech semantic communications.
By introducing nonlinear transform and variational modeling,
we effectively capture the dependencies within speech frames
and estimate the probabilistic distribution of the speech feature
more accurately, giving rise to better compression performance.
In particular, the speech signals are analyzed and synthesized by a
pair of nonlinear transforms, yielding latent features. An entropy
model with hyperprior is built to capture the probabilistic
distribution of latent features, followed with quantization and
entropy coding. The proposed waveform codec can be optimized
flexibly towards arbitrary rate, and the other appealing feature is
that it can be easily optimized for any differentiable loss function,
including perceptual loss used in semantic communications. To
further improve the fidelity, we incorporate residual coding to
mitigate the degradation arising from quantization distortion
at the latent space. Results indicate that achieving the same
performance, the proposed method saves up to 27% coding rates
than widely used adaptive multi-rate wideband (AMR-WB) codec
as well as emerging neural waveform coding methods."
