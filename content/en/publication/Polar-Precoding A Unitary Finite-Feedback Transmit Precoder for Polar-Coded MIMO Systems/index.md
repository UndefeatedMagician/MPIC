abstract: We propose a unitary precoding scheme, namely polar-precoding, to improve the performance of polar-coded MIMO systems. In contrast to the traditional design of MIMO precoding criteria, the proposed polar-precoding scheme relies on the polarization criterion. In particular, the precoding matrix design comprises two steps. After selecting a basic matrix for maximizing the capacity in the first step, we design a unitary matrix for maximizing the polarization effect among the data streams without degrading the capacity. Our simulation results show that the proposed polar-precoding scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art DFT precoding scheme.
