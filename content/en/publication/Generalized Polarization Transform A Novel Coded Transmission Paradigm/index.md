abstract: For the upcoming 6G wireless networks, a new wave of applications and services will demand ultra-high data rates and reliability. To this end, future wireless systems are expected to pave the way for entirely new fundamental air interface technologies to attain a breakthrough in spectrum efficiency (SE). This article discusses a new paradigm, named generalized polarization transform (GPT), to achieve an integrated design of coding, modulation, multi-antenna, multiple access, etc., in a real sense. The GPT enabled air interface develops far-reaching insights that the joint optimization of critical air interface ingredients can achieve remarkable gains on SE compared with the state-of-the-art module-stacking design.
