abstract: "The recent deep learning-based joint source-channel
coding (deep JSCC) framework has shown superior performance
on end-to-end wireless image transmission without suffering from
the “cliff effect”. However, a fundamental limit of current deep
JSCC schemes is that the unbalanced regional importance of the
source image has not been explicitly taken into account. It evenly
distributes the coding rate to every image patch leading to an
evident degradation of the overall coding efficiency. To break
this fundamental limit, we propose a novel end-to-end wireless
image transmission scheme in this paper. Our scheme integrates
the deep JSCC architecture and the quadtree-structured regional
rate allocation strategy adopted in the HEVC standard, collected
under the name “resolution-adaptive deep JSCC (RaDJSCC)”.
Our new architecture perceives the content of the transmitted
image and adaptively allocates more channel bandwidth to the
complex pixel blocks. Results show that for high-resolution
images, the proposed RaDJSCC transmission method generally
outperforms the emerging analog transmission schemes using
deep JSCC and the digital transmission schemes using classical
separated source and channel coding, e.g., BPG + LDPC. "
